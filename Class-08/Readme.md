=====================================

## Learning Objectives
1. The student will know and understand where and when to use a LINQ queries against a collection to extract data
2. Students will undestand the use of a Lambda statemetn and how to join them with LINQ queries

## Lecture Outline
- Review collections
  - Create a collection
  - Add data to the collection
  - iterate through the collection

1. What is an easier way to search for items in a collection?

## What is LINQ?
- Languatge Integrated Query

1. Imperative vs Declarative
   - What is imperative
     - Foreach loop
   - What is Declarative
     - LINQ statements
   - What is a 'query'
     - a query is an expression that, when enumerated, transforms sequences with query operators.
     - the standard query operators are implemented as extension methods, so we cAN CALL 'Where' directly onto the names. 

2. What are Lambda statements?
    // Show example of Lambda statements
    - Anonymous Objects
    - Anonymous Types

## Coding Challenge
Find the Nth Element from the end of a Linked List

- Using your "data-structures" repository created in class  2
  - add a folder and label it `Linked Lists`
  - add the code on a branch from this challenge into this repo
  - Describe your approach in the strings folder readme document
  - Submit a link to your repo PR in canvas
