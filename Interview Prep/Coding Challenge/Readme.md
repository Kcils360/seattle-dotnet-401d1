# Coding Practice

## Coding Challenge:
- You will have a 1 Hour time limit to solve a coding challenge for a small focused problem
- Should only be 10-15 (ish) lines of code
- They dont actually care about syntactically correct code.
- They **emphasized to us** that they care about process and problem solving, your C# code syntax is not the main focus
- During this phase, remember the steps that you've taken during your whiteboard practice. Psudeo Code out your steps first so they know what you are going to do.
- Write out the steps that you are going to take

**Example**: 

```Csharp
myNumber = 0
While myNumber is less than or equal to 100
OUTPUT myNumber 
IF myNumber is divisible by 3
output "Fizz"
EndIF

If myNumber is divisible by 5
output "Buzz"
EndIf

increase number by 1
End While


//C# code Here if there is time
```


## Best Ways to Prepare
1. Create an account on [Ed Republic](https://www.edrepublic.com/) Account
2. Review their different Coding Questions
3. The Microsoft Interview will have you code in an online coding environment similar to 
the Ed Republic environment. 
4. You may not have access to a debugger within the online IDE, so don't depend on that.
