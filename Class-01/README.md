## Readings
- [Selective Statements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/selection-statements)
- [Iteration Statements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/iteration-statements)
- [Build in data types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/built-in-types-table)

## Code Challenge 1
Write a method that takes one number as an argument. 
Iterate up to that number, with the output displayed as:
- For multiples of three return “Fizz”
- For multiples of five return “Buzz”. 
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five return “FizzBuzz”
- For all other cases return the number.
