## Coding Challenge

Operates on a strictly "first-in, first-out" basis. People must adopt either the "oldest" (based on arrival time) of all animals at the shelter, 
or they can select whether they would prefer a dog or a cat (and will receive the oldest animal of that type). T
hey cannot select which specific animal they would like. Create the data structures to maintain this system and 
implement operations such as enqueue, dequeue_any, dequeue_dog, and dequeue_cat.

### Setup
- Using your "data-structures" repository -
  - add a folder and label it `Misc Algorithms`
  - add the code on a branch from this challenge into this repo
  - Your Readme document should include your notes about the challenge.
	- What did you learn? 
		- Explain how you felt before starting the challenge, what did you learn while researching, and how well do you understand the data structure after your self research
	- Where did you look? 
		- Be specific, what sites? resources? Books?
	- What notes did you use to help you successfully complete the challenge? 
		- Did you write anything down, bookmark anything that looked useful? 
		- What did you use as a guideline or direction during the challenge?)
  - Submit a link to your repo PR in canvas
