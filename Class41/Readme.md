=====================================

## Readings
- [Design Patterns in ASP.NET](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/738043/Design-Patterns-in-ASP-NET)
- [Design Pattern FAQ](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/28309/Design-pattern-FAQ-Part-Training)
- Do some self research on the different types of Design Patterns.
	- Who is the Gang of Four (GoF)? 
	- How are the Design Patterns organized?
	- How many different design patterns are there?

## Coding Challenge
Towers of Hanoi:

Towers of Hanoi is a puzzle where you have 3 poles and a tower of N discs of decreasing size all stacked on the left-most pole. Consider this poorly-rendered ASCII text:

  |       |       |
  -       |       |
 ---      |       |
-----     |       |

The goal is to move all the discs from the left-most pole to the right-most pole. 

- There are two restrictions:
	1) you may only move one disc at a time and 
	2) a larger disc cannot be stacked on top of a smaller disc.

Write a function that implements a solution to this problem for N discs.


### Setup
- Using your "data-structures" repository -
  - add a folder and label it `Misc Algorithms`
  - add the code on a branch from this challenge into this repo
  - Your Readme document should include your notes about the challenge.
	- What did you learn? 
		- Explain how you felt before starting the challenge, what did you learn while researching, and how well do you understand the data structure after your self research
	- Where did you look? 
		- Be specific, what sites? resources? Books?
	- What notes did you use to help you successfully complete the challenge? 
		- Did you write anything down, bookmark anything that looked useful? 
		- What did you use as a guideline or direction during the challenge?)
  - Submit a link to your repo PR in canvas
  
  
  ### Rubric
  - 4 points: Readme includes notes of the challenge
